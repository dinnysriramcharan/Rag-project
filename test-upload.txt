This is a test document for the upload feature.

The AI Document Search system now supports:
- File upload through the web interface
- Drag and drop functionality
- Support for PDF, TXT, and MD files
- Automatic text extraction and chunking
- Vector embedding and storage in Pinecone

You can now upload documents directly from the UI instead of using command line scripts.
